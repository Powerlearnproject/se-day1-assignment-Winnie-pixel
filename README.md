#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a process that implements engineering methods, principles and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. This process is important in the technology industry as it enables the creation of software solutions which solve real life situations or problems. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software engineering has evolved over the decads to become an influential field owing to the changes that it has led to in other fields. One of the key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include the development of programming languages which have improved software and system development. Examples of early programing languages include Pascal Foratn and C with latest languages including python and Javascript. Programming languages have continued to evolves to adapt to changes making them more efficient and relatable to current software engineering needs. Another key milestone is the establishement of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s. The establishmnet involved setting regulations and standards around software development including setting up principle, theories, tools and techniques that are key to development of high quality proffesional software. A third major milestone in evolution of software engineering is the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s which have allowed for better project management based on changing needs.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement- involves gatheing and documenting the user needs and system requirements.
Design- creating detailed and high-level designs of the software architure and user interface.
Impelmentation- writing the code and buidling software based on teh design specifications. 
Testing- conducting various tests to ensure that the software meets the quality standards and funstional requirements. 
Deployemnet- Releasing the software to users
Maintanance- providing ongoing support, updates and enhancemnets to the software after deployement. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall software dveveloping methodology utilizes sequential approach with distinct phases whcih flow downward just like an actual waterfall. In waterfall methodology each step is influential for the next hence the sequential approach. For instance, take setting up fingerprint on a phone as a project, using waterfall approach, sequential phases wil involve opening settings, placing the fingers at the sensors then saving the changes. in this case the steps have to completed in this order for success of the process. On the other hand, agile methodologies utilize iterative and incremental approach that focuses on flexibility collaboration and responsing to changes. For instnance, when coming up with a new menu at a restaurant, agile methodology can be utilize where collaborating with different employees to add or remove some ingredients to makes meals better resembles the agile approach. 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The role of a software developer in the software engineering team involves writing code and implemnting softwar solutions. Responsibilities will also include communicating progress to the team and ensuring that product is delievered at teh projected time. On the other hand as a quality assurance engineer, responsibilities involve ensuring that the quality of the software and executing test plans. Lastly, as a project manager, roles involve overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software project. 
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Developmnet Environmnets (IDEs) provide comprehesive tools for writing and testing codes. Examples of IDEs include Eclipse and Visual Studio. Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools that track changes to source codes and cordination among team members. Examples of VCS include Git and Subversion. IDEs and VCS are important as they increase collaboration and code quality as they provide key features such as version control, automated testing and debugging. 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Testing is a key part of ensuring software quality so as to deliver the expected product that adheres to required standards. there are different types of testing including unit testing whcih involves testing inividual components of a software. Unite testing is specific and seeks to determine is each individual compoenet is well-functioning. Another type of testing is syctem testing which involves testing the entire system as a whole. Integration testing involves testing interaction between different components whcih seeks to see if these subsystems function together effectively. Acceptance testing involves testing software against different user requiremet to ensure that it meets the user needs. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a process that involves crafying questions or instructions ina  way that helps get the best repsoncses from AI. On the other hand AI models are systems that can perform tasks that ususally require human intelligence such as decision making. Prompt engineering is key in interacting with AI models as they provide a defined set of instructions on how these models can respond to various querries. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt: tell me about nursing
imporved prompt: What is the history and origin of nursing in Kenya 
The seconf prompt is more effective because it provides more specific informatin that is clear on what information about nursing that should be provided by the AI. This is unlike the first statement which is general and does not specify the key details of the topic.
